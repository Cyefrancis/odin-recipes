    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Here's a recipe for donuts you can make at home</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 c. plus 1 tsp. granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 packet (or 2 1/4 tsp.) active dry yeast </li>
        <li>4 1/2 c. all-purpose flour, plus more for surface</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 tbsp. butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract Canola or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <h4>For glaze</h4>
        <li>1/4 c. whole milk</li>
        <li>2 c. powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with cooking spray and set aside. In a small, microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, add milk. Microwave until lukewarm, 40 seconds. Add a teaspoon of sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together remaining sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla with a wooden spoon. Pour in yeast mixture, mix to combine, then add in dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until elastic and only slightly tacky, adding more flour a teaspoon at a time if needed, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Form into a tight ball then place dough in oiled bowl and cover with a clean dish towel. Let dough rise in a warm spot in your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li><br>
        <li>Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Punch down dough, then turn onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out into a ½” thick rectangle. Using a doughnut cutter or 3” and 1” biscuit cutters, punch out your doughnuts. Re-knead scraps together and punch out as well. Place doughnuts and holes onto baking sheets, cover with dish towel, and let rise again, about 40 minutes more.</li><br>
        <li>Make glaze: In a large bowl, whisk together milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside</li><br>
        <li>Line a large baking sheet with paper towels. In a large dutch oven over medium heat, heat 2'' oil to 350°. Cook doughnuts, in batches, until deeply golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Holes will cook even faster!</li><br>
        <li>Transfer doughnuts to paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain and cool slightly. Dip into glaze, then place onto a cooling rack (or eat immediately!).</li><br>
    </ol>
